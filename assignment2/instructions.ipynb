    "# Comp451 HW2\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is adapted from [Stanford Course cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:\n",
    "- understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures\n",
    "- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation\n",
    "- implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks\n",
    "- implement Dropout to regularize networks\n",
    "- understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data\n",
    "- gain experience with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "<strong>NOTE</strong>: If you have already set up your environment for the first assignment, you can skip this part.\n",
    "You can use the same environment in this assignment as well. However, you should still check out the Package Dependencies section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Anaconda:** If you decide to work locally, we recommend using the free [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which provides an easy way for you to handle package dependencies. Please be sure to download the Python 3 version, which currently installs Python 3.7. We are no longer supporting Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda Virtual environment:** Once you have Anaconda installed, it makes sense to create a virtual environment for the course. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed globally on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run (in a terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n comp451 python=3.7 anaconda`\n",
    "\n",
    "to create an environment called comp451.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to activate and enter the environment, run\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate comp451`\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit, you can simply close the window, or run\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda deactivate comp451`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run `conda activate comp451` (change to the name of your virtual env).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may refer to [this page](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more detailed instructions on managing virtual environments with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package Dependencies\n",
    "If you have `pip` installed on your system (normally conda does it by default), you may use `pip` to install the\n",
    "necessary python packages conveniently. From the project root, type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will install the correct versions of the dependency packages listed in the requirements.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the starter code (regardless of which method you choose above), you will need to download the CIFAR-10\n",
    " dataset. Make sure `wget` is installed on your machine before running the commands below. Run the following from the \n",
    " assignment2 directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd comp451/datasets\n",
    "./get_datasets.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start IPython:\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server from the assignment2 directory, with the jupyter notebook command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you can also refer the [IPython tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (38 points)\n",
    "The IPython notebook <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">FullyConnectedNets.ipynb</code> will introduce you to our modular\n",
    " layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these \n",
    " models you will implement several popular update rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Dropout (13 points)\n",
    "The IPython notebook <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Dropout.ipynb</code> will help you implement Dropout and explore\n",
    "its effects on model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Convolutional Networks (27 points)\n",
    "In the IPython Notebook <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb</code> you will implement several \n",
    "new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: PyTorch on CIFAR-10 (22 points)\n",
    "For this last part, you will be working in PyTorch, a popular and powerful deep learning framework.\n",
    "Open up <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">PyTorch.ipynb</code>. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating\n",
    "in training a  convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip (do not use RAR) the assignment folder using the format `username_studentid_assignment2.zip`.\n",
    "Email the zip file to the instructor and TA (Cemil). Do not include large files in the submission (for\n",
    "instance data files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 1: Make sure that your homework runs successfully. Otherwise, you may get a zero grade from the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 2: There are # *****START OF YOUR CODE/# *****END OF YOUR CODE tags denoting the start and end of code sections you should fill out. Take care to not delete or modify these tags, or your assignment may not be properly graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 3: The assignment2 code has been tested to be compatible with python version 3.7 (it may work with other versions of 3.x, but we wonâ€™t be officially supporting them). You will need to make sure that during your virtual environment setup that the correct version of python is used. You can confirm your python version by (1) activating your virtualenv and (2) running which python.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 4: If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may potentially encounter errors with matplotlib due to the \n",
    "[issues described here](https://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html). In our testing, it seems that this issue is no\n",
    " longer present with the most recent version of matplotlib, but if you do end up running into this issue you may have to\n",
    "  use the start_ipython_osx.sh script from the assignment2 directory (instead of jupyter notebook above) to launch your\n",
    "   IPython notebook server. Note that you may have to modify some variables within the script to match your version of\n",
    "    python/installation directory. The script assumes that your virtual environment is named .env.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "**macOS**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having problems with matplotlib (e.g. imshow), try running this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install python.app`\n",
    "\n"
